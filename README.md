## Experience

* Designed and implemented the key and data structures for storing, indexing and expiring parking sessions for REQS within Redis for rapid querying.
* Creator and maintainer of log4net.Raygun (https://github.com/plmwong/log4net-raygun), a log4net appender for sending exception data and contextual data to the raygun.io service.

### Intergen — Software Developer in Enterprise Applications
_January 2009 — April 2013 | Wellington, New Zealand_

Full gamut of the software developer cycle, including gathering user requirements, designing solutions, implementation and testing. Primarily used Microsoft technologies, working on a number of projects for a variety of different clients.

Also worked in a technical lead role on a couple of smaller (3 - 5 person) projects.

#### Projects

##### Kiwibank — InTouch Upgrade / Anti-Money Laundering Compliance
_« .NET 4.0 C#, WCF Services, Domain Driven Design, PostSharp AOP, CQRS, WPF, Prism, MVVM, AutoMapper »_

* Worked in a team of 10-12 developers to build a ground up replacement for Kiwibank’s existing customer and account management front-end desktop client.
* Took an ownership role in the design and framework development of the domain layer and application services using a Domain Driven Design (DDD) approach.
* Designed the framework used for validation, which used specifications and extension methods to provide validation rules that could be more readily shown to and understood by the business analysts when confirming that they were correct.

##### Tertiary Education Commission — Industry Training Register
_« .NET 3.5 C#, WCF Services, x.509 certificate security, SQL Server 2008, XSD design, soapUI web service testing »_

* Helped in the design and delivery of this education sector web service, which captures learner information (e.g. enrolments, course completions) from the Industry Training sector (~40 providers, ~10,000 messages/day). This new capability for capturing accurate and up-to-date information has saved the TEC millions of dollars in funding.
* Lead Developer on a follow-up project to resolve user issues, and provide extra functions; in consultation with Industry Training providers and the Data Warehouse team. Personally improved the performance of daily jobs by 70% using indexes and optimizing database repository code.
* Prototyped the asynchronous messaging architecture and implemented x.509 message security through a custom WCF binding.
* Constructed the framework for running automated end-to-end web service tests using soapUI, allowing for a full regression suite of full functional tests to run nightly.
* Implemented key integration with external data source dependencies by creating proxy WCF services, which translated requests / responses with these third-party web services and presented a simpler, common interface internally.

##### Sproket Markets — PartsTrader US Pilot
_« .NET 4.0 C#, ASP.NET MVC3, WCF Services, jQuery, Entity Framework 4, SQL Server 2008 »_

* Implemented 6-8 screens for the pilot of this online car parts tendering system (commissioned by State Farm Insurance), designed to bring more competition and transparency to the auto repair market.
